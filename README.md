Because soundtrack mods just aren't enough!

Cycle through many series' music with L and R, and listen to the community's favourite OSTs!

## Request a song:
### Rules:
1: NO NSFW content. This should be obvious

2: No slurs. Cursing is fine, but no slurs.

3: Do not share personal information about yourself nor others through audio, script or sprite in this mod.

4: Keep songs related to any drama to a minimum. I understand "seperate art from artist", however I nor anyone else who contributed to this mod would like to be involved in the drama.
